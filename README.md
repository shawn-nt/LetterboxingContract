# LetterboxingContract
This is the code of our contracts and hardhat setup for the letterboxing dapp

This should not be considered "safe" code.  As of 7/12/22 the contract has been left largely open for experimentation and mischief. Any NFTs minted on this contract 
could have resources added to their nft without consent, for example.
